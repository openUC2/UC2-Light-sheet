# openUC2 *Lightsheet Microscope*
---

We will start setting up the documentation to rebuild the UC2-based lightsheet microscope that features a single mode fiber, a low-cost monochromatic camera and an accurate, yet low-cost XYZ stage mechanism.

The final result may look like this:

</p>

It is inspired by the design of the [openspim](openspim.org).

# Software
*HOW DO I CONTROL THIS THING?*

## Custom Python code *IF APPLICABLE*
We also provide a code example for driving the device using a python driver. Please refer to the code and the package in the folder [PYTHON](./PYTHON).

## *CUSTOM FANCY SOFTWARE*
We also provide *SOME SORCERY* for driving the device. Find the files in folder [*MY_AWESOME_SOFTWARE*]().

# Hardware

Below we describe how the device can be build and assembled in order to replicate the whole system as shown in the rendering above. One needs additional parts that can be found in the core [openUC2 repository](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT).


## Bill of material

Below you will find all components necessary to build this device

### 3D printing files

All these files need to be printed. We used a Prusa i3 MK3 using PLA Prusament (Galaxy Black) at layer height x.x mm and infill xx%.


|  Type | Details  |  Price | Link  |
|---|---|---|---|
| *FANCY* Holder |  *IT HOLD OTHER FANCY PARTS* |  x,xx € | [Part.stl](./STL/)  |


### Additional parts
This is used in the current version of the setup
